# âœ… Day 16 of #gfg160 - Check if Two Strings are Anagrams

## ðŸ§  Problem:
Given two strings, determine whether they are anagrams of each other â€” that is, whether they contain the same characters in the same frequency, but possibly in a different order.

## ðŸ“œ Approach:
1. Step 1: Validate lengths. If different, they cannot be anagrams.

2. Step 2: Count character frequencies for the first string.

3. Step 3: Decrease counts based on the second string.

- If any character is missing or count goes negative, strings are not anagrams.

4. Step 4: If all counts balance perfectly, strings are anagrams.
